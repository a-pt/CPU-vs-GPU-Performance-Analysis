# CPU-vs-GPU-Performance-Analysis
In this project, benchmarking tests were  performed between CPU and GPU in  the field of Deep Learning. GeForce  GTX 1660 Ti and AMD Ryzen 7 CPU  was used during tests.  A system for classifying images with  Feed forward Neural Network (FNN)  architecture was used to compare  performance during testing.
